This program generates grades of 19 high school students of 6 different subjects, Math, Physics, Recreation, History, English, and Chemistry. First, this program generates a random grade for each student in each subject from 0 to 100. This data is then used to calculate various statistics for each class (maximum, minimum, average, median, standard deviation). Using matplotlib, a scatter plot was used to show the grades of students in each class. After that, a box plot was used for the grades in the history class. Finally, a histogram was used for the math grades.
